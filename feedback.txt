lab for random forest was well written
neural network published notes
really liked the boosting notes

missed having neural net notes

would like to have the reading match the lectures/assignments

great reading materials and exercises in the daily released repos . I would like to
study these before the class. Any chance these could be released the week before.

*********************

sean released repo . checks in with me that i understand what is going on.
VERY useful for me to have mongo setup so i could follow along with Cary
during the lecture

cary gave an overview of natural language processing and used on-line lecture
and gave a great overview of where this fits into the circulum

why do web scraping and where to put it into a database. went over slides
with visual explanations of web scraping and databases. and why mongodb
instead of other databases.


Sean web scraping great job going over the lecture notes and understanding
of mongodb and python
